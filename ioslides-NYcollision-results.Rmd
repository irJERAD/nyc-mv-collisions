## Goal

**Reducing Accidents in Brooklyn**    

The analysis for this deck and the accompanying [Data Exploration R Notebook](http://jerad.xyz/projects/flatly-float.html) and Dashboard was primarily generated from the NYC Open Data [Vehicle Collision Data Set](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95).  

**Influential factors on this work include:**

- City Council Stake Holders    
    + Can leverage their greatest impact in local law and policy (how can law and policy be used to reduce accidents in Brooklyn)    
- Identify factors correlated with accidents    
    + Awareness can reduce incedent by assisting drivers in pursuing their own interest to keep themselves alive and whole    
- Understand The NYC Collosion Data        
    + In the act of working with data an analyst can grow an empathy toward its tendencies        
        + Maturing their intuition on the matter and adding to a now enhanced skillset for use on this problem as well as future works

# Events Over Time

<h3>Visualize number of accidents each hour of each weekday to:</h3>   
<div style="color: orange">
<font size="6">
<ul>
<li>Visually search for patterns   
<ul>
<li>Take advantage of priori knowledge (e.g. human nature toward a weekly schedule & routine)</li>
<li>People live, work and plan around a 7-day weekly schedule that has universal social influencers</li>   
<li>For example: a 9-5 workschedule or Weekends</li>   
</ul></li>
</ul>
</font>
</div>

## Hours of the Week {.smaller}
<div style="text-alight:center">
Look for daily and weekly patterns in the data
<iframe src="html_widgets/hourXday.html" style="height:450px; width:100%"></iframe>
Significant increase in events on weekdays vs weekend with the greatest number of incident aligning with commute times.
</div>

## Exploring Weather

Weather Data was collected from the NOAA API.  
Data on snow and rain fall was merged with accident data to search for what seems like an intuitive correlation.  
Oddly, no significant correlation was found; However, upon inspecting the data seasonally as was done for the weather, a pattern becomes clear. The pattern is across time and appears to be annual, consistently growing from 2012 to 2015 in all seasons and through to 2016 in Spring and Winter.  
Thus, we can support the premis of exploring extreme options with regard to vehicle safety in Brooklyn - including legal and campaigning.
